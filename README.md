# faust-bootstrap
This repository is a wrapper implementation of the [Faust](https://github.com/robinhood/faust) library.
It aims at easy development of Faust applications.
It uses the same interface as our common-kafka-streams project and can be deployed using the same Helm chart and configuration options.
Thereby, you can develop your Kafka applications in Java or Python as you wish without having to deal with different deployment configurations.

### Getting Started

You can install faust-bootstrap from pypi.

``pip install faust-bootstrap``

### Example

[Here](https://github.com/bakdata/common-kafka-streams-demo) can you get an use case example of both libraries.
