# faust-bootstrap
This repository is a wrapper implementation of the [Faust](https://github.com/robinhood/faust) library.
This library was designed to get something similar to our library [common-kafka-streams](https://github.com/bakdata/common-kafka-streams)
at the moment you are developing a Kafka Streams application for python. [Faust-bootstrap](https://github.com/bakdata/faust-bootstrap) can be really helpful
when you want to standardize the deployment part of your application when you use common-kafka-streams in your stack. 
Moreover, we try to keep things easier for you when you need to develop a Kafka Streams application in python and 
you are coming from a Java background.

### Getting Started

You can install faust-bootstrap from pypi.

``pip install faust-bootstrap``
